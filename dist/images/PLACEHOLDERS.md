# Placeholder Images

This repository includes some placeholder images to demonstrate the CDN structure and functionality.

## Current Placeholders

- `logos/logo.svg` - Sample Tolwaz logo placeholder
- `icons/home.svg` - Sample home icon placeholder

## Usage

These placeholders can be accessed via jsDelivr CDN:

```html
<!-- Logo placeholder -->
<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Salman-41/tolwaz-images@latest/dist/images/logos/logo.svg" 
     alt="Tolwaz Logo">

<!-- Icon placeholder -->
<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Salman-41/tolwaz-images@latest/dist/images/icons/home.svg" 
     alt="Home Icon">
```

## Replacing Placeholders

Replace these placeholder files with your actual brand assets:

1. Add your real logo files to `dist/images/logos/`
2. Add your actual icons to `dist/images/icons/`
3. Upload product images to `dist/images/products/`
4. Add banners to `dist/images/banners/`
5. Include UI elements in `dist/images/ui/`

Remember to optimize your images for web delivery before uploading!
